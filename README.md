# Grow Outside

[Live site](https://mattdahlseid.github.io/grow-outside/)

## Overview

This is a design concept for a fictitious nonprofit organization dedicated to connecting kids with nature. I created a prototype for the site using Adobe XD, then built the site according to the prototype. 

All photographs on the site are my own and may not be used without my permission.

## Acknowledgements 

I learned about using `position: sticky` for the Support section from this [SuperHi tutorial](https://www.superhi.com/video/how-to-make-a-split-screen-site-with-sticky-sides).

To figure out how to make the nav list items receive an active class when their corresponding sections were scrolled into the viewport, I reviewed and adapted code from this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43349026).
